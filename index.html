        <img src="/Users/davidschneider/Documents/Digital Crafts/About Me/images/image1.jpg" alt="About Me Profile Picture">
        <p>Born in Munich, Germany, I moved to the U.S. with my family in 1997 and grew up in Tampa, Florida. I attended the University of Florida, majoring in Psychology and Mass Communications. </p>
        <p>My interests and leisure pursuits include: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>screen and stage acting</li>
            <li>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</li>
            <li>meditation and yoga</li>
            <li>music (acoustic guitar and singing)</li>
            <li>reading (currently revisiting a favorite - "The Wise Man's Fear" by Patrick Rothfuss)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I'm looking forward to the upcoming course!</p>
